      The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deliver high-quality software. 
      It provides a systematic approach to building software applications, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and alignment with user requirements.

Objectives of SDLC
     1. Deliver High-Quality Software : Ensures the end product meets user expectations and requirements.
     2. Cost and Time Efficiency : Reduces waste and optimizes development timelines and resources.
     3. Error Minimization: Incorporates testing and feedback loops to catch issues early.
     4. Consistency : Follows a defined structure, ensuring repeatable and reliable outcomes.

Phases of SDLC

    1.Requirement Gathering and Analysis
    2.System Design
    3.Implementations 
    4.Testing  
    5.Deployment 
    6.Maintenance
    7.Benefits of SDLC
- Enhances project management and team collaboration.
- Improves risk management through defined processes.
- Ensures software reliability and scalability.
- Increases customer satisfaction by delivering tailored solutions.
